## Enhanced Big Picture: `earnings_release.ipynb`

### Overall Purpose

The `earnings_release.ipynb` notebook is a sophisticated analysis tool designed to:

- Automate the extraction of earnings release data from Yahoo Finance.
- Analyze stock performance and options metrics around the time of earnings releases.
- Provide visual insights into various aspects of stock and options data, which can help investors and analysts make informed decisions.

### Main Components and Workflow

#### Setup and Configuration
- **Initialization**: Load configuration and import required libraries and scripts. This sets the stage for the subsequent data processing and analysis.

#### Data Extraction
- **Yahoo Finance Scraping**: Use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape earnings data from Yahoo Finance. This involves navigating through multiple pages to gather comprehensive data.
- **Processing HTML Tables**: Extract and process HTML tables to collect ticker symbols and stock prices.

#### Data Processing
- **Convert to DataFrame**: The collected data is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: The DataFrame is sorted, and duplicate tickers are filtered out to ensure each stock is processed only once.

#### Analysis of Stock Options
- **Options Data Analysis**: For each ticker, the notebook analyzes options data to calculate various metrics such as total call and put volume, open interest, implied volatility, and the number of in-the-money and out-of-the-money options.
- **Key Function**:
    - `analyze_stock_options(ticker)`: This function performs the core analysis of stock options, filtering and aggregating data based on the stock's current price and a predefined price range factor.

#### Output Metrics
- **Printing Metrics**: The analyzed options metrics are printed for each ticker using:
    - `print_options_data(ticker, options_metrics)`: This function formats and displays the calculated metrics in a readable format.

#### Visualization
- **Plotting Stock History**: The notebook plots the historical stock prices using:
    - `plot_stock_history(ticker, start_date, end_date)`: This function visualizes the stock's performance over the specified date range.
- **Implied Volatility Skew**: Visualizes the skew of implied volatility for out-of-the-money options using:
    - `plot_iv_skew_otm_only(options_metrics, end_date, ticker)`: This function plots the implied volatility skew, showing the distribution of volatility across different strike prices and expiration dates.
- **Sector ETF Data**: Plots the historical performance of sector ETFs related to the stocks using:
    - `plot_etf_historical_data(ticker, start_date, end_date)`: This function provides insights into the broader sector trends by visualizing the ETF performance.

#### Clean-Up
- **Memory Management**: Deletes temporary data structures to free up memory and ensure efficient execution of the notebook.
